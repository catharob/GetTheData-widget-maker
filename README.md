# Get-the-data Widget Code Maker

Designed by Catherine Roberts for [Inside Energy](http://insideenergy.org/)

### What does this program do?

This is a program that will take the URL of a GitHub page and the URL of a Google Sheet and insert them into the Wordpress code used for Inside Energy's "Get the data" widget.

### What does the widget do?

The widget is used to make Inside Energy's data easily accessible and downloadable. 

It links to a direct download of a CSV and an XLSX file, to a publicly viewable Google Sheet file of the data, and to the folder for the data in Inside Energy's [Data Battery](https://github.com/InsideEnergy/Data-for-stories), the central data repository. 

### Current Version

This version will handle a folder containing a README and multiple csv/xlsx pairs.

The user can input the URL of the folder in Inside Energy's `Data-for-stories` folder. The program will then prompt the user to enter the corresponding Google Sheets public viewing URL, and output the widget code to paste into WordPress.

### Development

The iPython notebook in this repo is the place I am testing and writing code for the basic program and its improvements. The first version of the program can be found in input line 61. Currently the new version is at the very end of the notebook.

### How to Run this Program
