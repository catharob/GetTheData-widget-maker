# Get-the-data Widget Code Maker

Designed by Catherine Roberts for [Inside Energy](http://insideenergy.org/)

### What does this program do?

This is a program that will take the URL of a GitHub page and the URL of a Google Sheet and insert them into the Wordpress code used for Inside Energy's "Get the data" widget.

### What does the widget do?

The widget is used to make Inside Energy's data easily accessible and downloadable. 

It links to a direct download of a CSV and an XLSX file, to a publicly viewable Google Sheet file of the data, and to the folder for the data in Inside Energy's [Data Battery](https://github.com/InsideEnergy/Data-for-stories), the central data repository. 

### Current Version

The first version of the program will **ONLY** handle a folder that contains three items: the `README.md` file, the CSV file, and the XLSX file. 

**This means, reporters, that if you have a folder with *more than one data file* (for instance, if your story contained two graphs, and you therefore had to upload two CSV/XLSX file pairs), for now, you'll have to compile the widget code manually, as we did at [the training](https://github.com/InsideEnergy/IE-datarepo-training).**

In the near future, I plan to improve this program to handle those instances. For now, however, use this for your simplest data folders.

### In Development

The iPython notebook in this repo is the place I am testing and writing code for what will become the new, more robust version. In this commit, the notebook returns the program to an erlier stage. The working program can be found on input line 61.
